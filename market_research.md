# What market is

First, it is the energy export market - starting from simply restoring the energy deficit in communities (can be calculated by the number of population and consumption per person, annual average) and ending with exports to neighboring communities (larger market, limited by the country's population or energy deficit) or abroad (an even larger market, theoretically you can find data on how much the European grid is ready to accept as an upper limit).

It is possible to calculate in backward way - what communities or cities can afford to deploy solar power plant.
